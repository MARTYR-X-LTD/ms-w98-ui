# MS W98 UI
MS W98 UI is a conversion of the original MS Sans Serif, which was the default system UI typeface of **Microsoft Windows 3.1, 95, 98 and ME**.

This is not an exclusive martyr⁠— creation, but rather a continuation of the work of many different authors.

#### Background

The initial typeface was developed by Microsoft for earlier versions of Windows. The original fonts used a vastly different format, incompatible with modern systems. Extensive work had to be done to convert them into usable standards like OTF and TTF.

The conversion process was carried out by [Lev Leontev](https://stackoverflow.com/users/6120487/lev-leontev). I discovered it in this [Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/54023769).

<span data-mce-fragment="1">Nonetheless, some fixes had to be made to make it work properly with Photoshop and other design applications.</span> Just to name a few: rendering was not pixel perfect, a lot of characters needed manual fixes, baselines and sizes were different for each of the fonts, and hinting needed to be disabled. And more.

And that's martyr⁠— contribution :)

The release is free and credits to all the contributors behind the work been done for each font. Naming some: Microsoft, [Lev Leontev](https://stackoverflow.com/users/6120487/lev-leontev), and **martyr⁠—**
